### A semi functional edge-detecting autodraw bot

Line drawing bot for skribbl/sketchful. Currently a work in progress.
Requires `opencv-python`, `keyboard` and `pyautogui`.

First, run `mousepos.py` to find all the necessary values for `constants.py`.

Run `draw.py` to draw an image. Press `r` to start the drawing after navigating to the desired window.
